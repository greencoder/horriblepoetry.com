As a special treat for the holidays, DynaMars Corporation is pleased to announce the activation of HOLIDAY PROTOCOL TX-0992. At 0000 hours, all station lights will automatically turn green or red. Enjoy the festive colored lighting! DynaMars Corporation wishes you a very happy holiday season.

**12-07-2305 - New Entry**

Chief Medical Officer Brugmann has informed us of a 100% increase in headaches and eyestrain following the activation of HOLIDAY PROTOCOL TX-0992. Unfortunately, we cannot disable HOLIDAY PROTOCOL TX-0992 without triggering HOLIDAY FAILSAFE CX-11951. It is in the best interest of all Cycnus Station personnel that HOLIDAY FAILSAFE CX-11951 not be triggered.

We are pleased to report that HOLIDAY PROTOCOL TX-0992 will shut down automatically at 0000 hours on 01-01-2306. No need to intervene!

**12-08-2305 - New Entry**

DynaMars Corporation wishes to congratulate Resident #013 for his outstanding work in Sector C Quantum Labs. Resident #013's pioneering research into the field of intrabladder entanglement may one day produce a cure for urination. DynaMars Corporation is throwing its full support behind this important scientific endeavor. Resident #013 has already received a generous grant from DynaMars Corporation's Dark Projects Department!

Congratulations, Resident #013!

**12-10-2305 - New Entry**

As part of Phase 2 of HOLIDAY PROTOCOL TX-0992, the Cycnus Station Intercom System has been commandeered for the purpose of playing pleasant holiday music 24 hours a day!

Phase 2 also triggered EMERGENCY MESS HALL MENU OVERRIDE LM-2324. Expect delicious ham to be served on Christmas Day!

DynaMars Corporation is committed to bringing the complete holiday experience to Mars.

**12-13-2305 - New Entry**

Good news abounds, Cycnus Station residents!

Resident #013 reports success in Quantum Labs Experiment #88-0984. Resident #013 was able to successfully teleport the bladder contents from one mouse to another. Although further tests are necessary, DynaMars Corporation believes human trials are inevitable.

As an additional holiday bonus, be on the lookout for a visit from the Lunar City Children's Choir! They'll be stopping by to spread some joy on their way to the Interstellar Choir Competition, held annually in the gymnasium of the Hercules-Transmag-Bovine Corporation's Deep Core Research Facility #002 on Titan. Be sure to visit the Sector D Concert Hall at 1200 hours on 12-15-2305!

**12-15-2305 - New Entry**

DynaMars Corporation regrets to inform all Cycnus Station personnel that the Lunar City Children's Choir concert in Sector D has been canceled. As it turns out, Lunar City does not have a children's choir, and the ship that landed in the Sector A Shipyards today actually belonged to members of the Mercury Syndicate pirate organization.

While it is possible that the pirates could perform the concert as planned, Chief Security Officer Hendren feels it is in the best interest of station safety to keep them confined. As such, we have locked down Sector A Shipyards and Cargo Bay to prevent the pirates from causing any harm.

Chief Security Officer Hendren assures us that the pirates will not be able to penetrate the bulkhead doors connecting Sector A with Sector B Explosive Barrel Storage.

**12-16-2305 - New Entry**

DynaMars Corporation wishes to apologize to the friends, colleagues, and family of the 76 crewmembers killed in today's deadly explosion. It appears members of the Mercury Syndicate succeeded in cutting through the bulkhead doors connecting Sector A with Sector B by using the high-powered torches stored in the Sector A Cargo Bay.

Unfortunately, they also ignited an explosive barrel, triggering a catastrophic chain reaction that blew up all of Sector A and Sector B. On the bright side, Chief Security Officer Hendren assures us that all of the pirates are dead and, that until the Mercury Syndicate decides to retaliate, Cycnus Station is completely safe.

In some good news, Phase 3 of HOLIDAY PROTOCOL TX-0992 will take effect tomorrow at 0000 hours. All red and green station lights will begin blinking in tune with the music playing endlessly over the Cycnus Station Intercom System.

**12-17-2305 - New Entry**

DynaMars Corporation would like to apologize to the families of the eleven crewmembers taken hostage by the Mercury Syndicate. Unfortunately, several pirates survived by hiding out in the armor-protected Cycnus Station Emergency Personnel Carrier.

Chief Security Officer Hendren is confident he will be able to rescue the crewmembers before they are secreted away from Mars and auctioned off as sex slaves. He has already deployed a dozen Mobile Defense Sentry Units to hunt down and exterminate the pirates, now believed to be hiding out in the Sector E Hydroponics Lab.

The unlucky crewmembers were reportedly extremely disoriented and fatigued, making them easy prey for pirates. While many are quick to blame HOLIDAY PROTOCOL TX-0992, DynaMars Corporation feels that such conclusions are in haste. HOLIDAY PROTOCOL TX-0992 is designed solely to encourage holiday cheer by utilizing safe, time-tested delivery vectors.

**12-18-2305 - New Entry**

Phase 4 of HOLIDAY PROTOCOL TX-0992 has begun! All Mobile Defense Sentry Units are now distributing hard candy in lieu of bullets. While this may interfere with Chief Security Officer Hendren's plans to kill pirates, DynaMars Corporation wishes to remind all residents that HOLIDAY PROTOCOL TX-0992 cannot be terminated without incurring extreme consequences.

In other news, Resident #013 reports that he is ready to begin human testing on his revolutionary intrabladder entanglement experiment. The bladder contents of Specimen #10802-B, a male Labrador Retriever, were successfully teleported to a nearby bucket. Although Specimen #10802-B went insane and had to be put down, humans should prove to be far more agreeable subjects.

**12-21-2305 - New Entry**

Resident #013 reports a minor setback in his intrabladder entanglement experiment. It seems the Intrabladder Entanglement Pattern Buffer is unable to properly unload patterns and is endlessly duplicating the stored contents of Specimen #10802-B's bladder. To prevent total pattern buffer overload, the device must be manually voided every 108 minutes.

Commanding Officer Miller is assigning all crewmembers a shift monitoring the Intrabladder Entanglement Pattern Buffer. Shift duties include entering a code that will teleport copies of Specimen #10802-B's urine to a nearby bucket, which must then be emptied in Sector F Waste Processing.

Chief Security Officer Hendren reports that he has safely rescued three of the eleven hostages from the Mercury Syndicate pirates. Unfortunately, Chief Security Officer Hendren and the entire Cycnus Station Security Team were taken hostage in the process. DynaMars Coropration wishes Chief Security Officer Hendren and his boys the very best in getting out of this mess!

DynaMars Corporation wishes to remind all residents that suicide is not an acceptable method for evading HOLIDAY PROTOCOL TX-0992. If you are considering suicide, please report to Commanding Officer Miller for immediate reprimand.

**12-22-2305 - New Entry**

Good news! Resident #013 has devised a surefire solution to the hostage crisis. By pointing the Intrabladder Entanglement Pattern Buffer in the direction of the Mercury Syndicate pirates, he believes he will be able to incapacitate them all with minor bladder infections and/or frequent urination. DynaMars Corporation is throwing its full support behind this ingenious plan!

Commanding Officer Miller wishes to inform all crewmembers that anyone caught attempting to override HOLIDAY PROTOCOL TX-0992 will be severely punished.

**12-23-2305 - New Entry**

Residnt #013 reports his plan has failed. Due to the extreme moisture in the Sector E Hydroponics Lab, the Intrabladder Entanglement Pattern Buffer was unable to target any of the pirates. As an unintended side effect, it has begun unloading copies of Specimen #10802-B's urine into the bladders of all nearby crew.

Chief Medical Officer Brugmann is offering antibiotics, and reminds all personnel that it is a really bad idea to carry dog urine inside your own bladder for any amount of time.

**12-24-2305 - New Entry**

We regret to inform you that Commanding Officer Miller has been captured by a group of Mercury Syndicate pirates. Commanding Officer Miller was unable to defend himself as he was busy trying to evacuate the dog urine from his continuously refilling bladder.

To prevent catastrophic overflows in Sector F Waste Processing, AUTOMATIC TOILET SHUTDOWN PROTOCOL ZX9 has initiated. DynaMars Corporation kindly requests that all residents urinate in Cycnus Station Auxiliary Shed #06 until Sector F Waste Processing can catch up.

**12-25-2305 - New Entry**

Commanding Officer Miller, acting at the behest of the Mercury Syndicate, managed to successfully override HOLIDAY PROTOCOL TX-0992, triggering HOLIDAY FAILSAFE CX-11951. As anticipated, HOLIDAY FAILSAFE CX-11951 immediately rescinded EMERGENCY MESS HALL MENU OVERRIDE LM-2324 via EMERGENCY HOLIDAY HAM VAPORIZATION PROTOCOL KH-9934. Sector I Mess Hall will now be serving the previously scheduled meal, consisting of a grim selection of beans.

In some good news, Resident #013 was able to retarget the malfunctioning Intrabladder Entanglement Pattern Buffer away from residents and directly at the pirates. Unfortunately, as the buffer was nearly overloaded with Specimen #10802-B's endlessly replicating urine pattern, the pirates were completely exploded along with all nearby hostages. Until further notice, the Sector E Hydroponics Lab is off limits. As a precaution, DynaMars Corporation has asked Resident #013 to unplug the Intrabladder Entanglement Pattern Buffer until further notice.

Sadly, Commanding Officer Miller and Chief Security Officer Hendren were among the casualties. Replacement personnel have already been requisitioned and are scheduled to arrive on 01-14-2306. DynaMars Corporation wishes to thank you for your hard work and understanding during this joyous holiday time!
