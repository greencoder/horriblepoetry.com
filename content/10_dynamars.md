Welcome to the new Cycnus Station Update Service, Resident #013!

This kiosk is designed to keep you updated on all relevant station activity within your clearance level. Your security clearance is LEVEL 3. DynaMars Corporation wishes to remind you that sharing sensitive information with subordinates will result in criminal prosecution.

Please take advantage of the Cycnus Station Update Service, accessible from kiosks located in the entrances to each sector, for all the latest news!

Please read each update in full.

Good news, Cycnus Station residents!

At 0800 hours today, the U.S.S. Buford docked in Sector A Shipyards carrying vital supplies and replacement personnel. DynaMars Corporation wishes to introduce you to Commanding Officer Grant! Commanding Officer Grant has extensive experience working in the Marketing Department of our corporate headquarters in beautiful Sioux Falls, South Dakota. He comes highly recommended by his peers, all extremely eager to see him start a new life on Mars.

Many of you are no doubt wondering when LOGMAN will be brought back online. We are sad to report that the Logistics-Oriented Global Martian Administrative Network will remain permanently offline. DynaMars Corporation assures you that this choice was not motivated by the recent over-sensationalized incident at Europa Dig Site #82. Although the AI running that station did kill over 587 workers, it was an isolated incident. Thus, Commanding Officer Grant is here to stay!

**08-17-2305 - New Entry**

The DynaMars Corporation is sad to report that Commanding Officer Grant has passed away due to complications resulting from an impacted bowel. As it is now evident from U.S.S. Buford restroom logs, Commanding Officer Grant failed to defecate during the 36-day voyage to Mars. In keeping with his religious beliefs, he will not be baconized. Those wishing to pay their respects to Commanding Officer Grant can make a donation to his favorite cause: DynaMars Corporation's Dark Projects Department.

By way of impartial lottery, Sector A Cargo Bay's Chief Forklift Operator Miller has been promoted. Please congratulate Commanding Officer Miller on his new job!

Bedbugs be gone! DynaMars Corporation is pleased to report that fumigation will begin on 08-20-2305 at 0500 hours. During this time you will be required to vacate the station. Cycnus Station Auxiliary Shed #06 should provide adequate shelter for all personnel with only a slight sacrifice in comfort, personal space, and restroom facilities. It even has a kiosk!

Chief Medical Officer Brugmann will be issuing sedatives to prevent any outbreaks of cabin fever, so the entire stay should be brief, pleasant, and uneventful.

**08-18-2305 - New Entry**

Commanding Officer Miller is pleased to report that the damage caused by Specimen #11598-A has been fully repaired. Unfortunately, the repairs triggered an electrical surge in the Sector C Beef Containment Chamber, which resulted in an estimated 300 tons of super-heated liquid beef product being released into the Martian atmosphere. Although it may look extremely pleasant outside, please do not leave the station without adequate protection.

Due to the lack of fissionable beef, Commanding Officer Miller has regretfully issued a full moratorium on taco nights. DynaMars Corporation wishes to apologize for the inconvenience.

Resident #012, now acting as Chief Forklift Operator, has reported 100% progress in his assigned task of removing all the bags of cedar chips from Cycnus Station Auxiliary Shed #06. Not only will Auxiliary Shed #06 boast enough room for everyone, it will also feature a pleasant cedar smell.

**08-19-2305 - New Entry**

DynaMars Corporation wishes to apologize to all Cycnus Station residents for the minor mix up that occurred on 06-28. An intern mistakenly transmitted GREEN PROTOCOLS to LOGMAN instead of LOGMAN EMERGENCY SERVICE PACK AND PERSONALITY DEFECT HOT FIX #924.

Due to the installation of GREEN PROTOCOLS, Cycnus Station is dangerously behind in meeting its mandated carbon footprint. DynaMars Corporation wishes to encourage all Cycnus Station residents to increase their greenhouse gas emissions as much as possible. Together, we can make Mars habitable!

In the meantime, Cycnus Station Solar Arrays #01-#12 are being taken offline. The Sector G Auxiliary Coal Plant is being brought online at full capacity. This was a necessary step due to the Solar Arrays being coated with a thick layer of beefy paste.

**08-20-2305 - New Entry**

Commanding Officer Miller reports great success in relocating all personnel to Cycnus Station Auxiliary Shed #06. Unfortunately, Auxiliary Shed #06 is one person over capacity, so by way of impartial lottery, Resident #010 has been assigned to sleep in the nearby Ares Station. DynaMars Corporation would like to assure Resident #010 that, although abandoned, Ares Station remains one of the safest places on Mars.

DynaMars Corporation wishes to apologize to Cycnus Station personnel on behalf of Chief Medical Officer Brugmann, who mistakenly injected everyone with doses of phencyclidine instead of the mild sedative that was promised. We advise all residents to remain calm and refrain from throwing things or each other. The fumigation will be done by 0600 tomorrow, so there is no need to panic. Please sit back, relax, and enjoy the pleasant aroma of cedar!

As a safety measure, no further phencyclidine injections will be authorized.

**08-21-2305 - New Entry**

DynaMars Corporation extends its deepest sympathies to the friends and families of the 238 Cycnus Station residents killed in the brutal orgy of violence, rape, and cannibalism that erupted in Auxiliary Shed #06. Although we know phencyclidine is a powerful chemical, it is no excuse to disregard station protocol. We are hereby issuing all surviving blood orgy participants with performance citations. Please refrain from this sort of behavior in the future.

DynaMars Corporation regrets to inform all residents of a slight delay with the fumigation. The contractor in charge of fumigation is indicating that the job will take an additional 4 days to complete. In the meantime, residents are advised to hunker down and enjoy this rustic retreat for a little longer!

Although there are a large number of bodies now occupying Auxiliary Shed #06, Chief Medical Officer Brugmann is certain that the strong cedar aroma will mask any unpleasant smells they might produce.

**08-22-2305 - New Entry**

Surviving residents are advised to ignore the ominous transmissions coming from Ares Station. In all likelihood, Resident #010 mistakenly activated a damaged subsystem, causing the station to automatically transmit dire predictions of death. DynaMars Corporation wishes to remind all residents that these predictions are the beliefs of a damaged Ares Station subsystem, and not those of the DynaMars Corporation itself.

**08-23-2305 - New Entry**

DynaMars Corporation wishes to remind all surviving Auxiliary Shed #06 residents not to open the airlock, no matter how sincere Resident #010 may sound. Although he is somehow surviving outside without any form of protection, it is likely due to the increased volume of beef in the atmosphere. DynaMars Corporation is also confident Resident #010 is lying when he claims to own a little piece of your soul.

Furthermore, Chief Medical Officer Brugmann is 100% certain his head will explode at any moment.

**08-24-2305 - New Entry**

Please disregard Resident #010's continued threats. Although he may claim to be the human vessel for an all-powerful evil capable of feasting on souls, this is not the case. As observed by Chief Medical Officer Brugmann, Resident #010 is suffering from a unique strain of cabin fever rendering him immune to the effects of Mars' inhospitable atmosphere.

Although many of you are reporting seeing your loved ones standing outside, beckoning you to join them, they are not real. Chief Medical Officer Brugmann is certain that these phantoms are the result of regular cabin fever coupled with light bouncing off ionized beef particles falling to the surface.

Please remain indoors until Commanding Officer Miller gives the green light to return to Cycnus Station.

**08-25-2305 - New Entry**

Exactly as Chief Medical Officer Brugmann predicted, Resident #010's head exploded. Unfortunately, this has not stopped him from beating on the airlock door. Although severely headless, Resident #010 remains a threat. Please continue ignoring him and the ghostly apparitions of your loved ones, as they are merely the result of stress and ionized beef particles.

Kudos to Resident #013 for his enterprising solution to the Resident #010 dilemma. Using the Cycnus Station Emergency Personnel Carrier's Remote Control, he was able to run over Resident #010 several times, eliminating his ability to move.

Commanding Officer Miller has given the green light for all survivors to return to Cycnus Station. Although the fumigator has failed to respond to radio transmissions for the past 24 hours, DynaMars Corporation is confident that he is fine and simply too busy working.

**08-26-2305 - New Entry**

Welcome to the new Cycnus Station! Due to a clerical error, the contractor hired to fumigate Cycnus Station turned out to be a painter, and he managed to paint half the station. Unfortunately, he was unable to finish the job, as a hardy beef blockage in the Sector G Auxiliary Coal Plant caused carbon dioxide emissions inside the station to reach lethal levels. Thankfully, this took care of the bedbug problem as well.

However, as certain station personnel were all too eager to return to Cycnus Station, they failed to observe proper sterilization protocols and reintroduced the bedbugs right back into the station. DynaMars Corporation wishes to remind all residents that safety and patience go hand in hand.

Due to the recent manpower shortages, all surviving crewmembers will be required to work overtime until replacements arrive. A full complement of personnel and one licensed fumigator are already in route and should arrive in 14 days times.

DynaMars Corporation hopes that these recent tragedies will serve as inspiration to all Cycnus Station residents to work hard and stay positive!
