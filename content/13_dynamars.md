**06-09-2306 - New Entry**

DynaMars Corporation is pleased to report that it has completed its efforts to re-staff Cycnus Station! Cycnus Station now boasts an impressive personnel detail of over 200 talented men and women, plus one very friendly android. Interim Commanding Officer Golding has the full support of DynaMars Corporation up until we find a qualified replacement.

Welcome to Mars! Together, we will make the Red Planet green!

In light of our recent disagreements with the Colonial Government over certain so-called "crimes against humanity," we will no longer be utilizing clones to maintain any DynaMars Corporation facility. In keeping with court rulings, all clones of Resident #012 have been humanely baconized.

**06-10-2306 - New Entry**

Interim Commanding Officer Golding would like to remind all station personnel that the identity of the friendly android is off limits. As androids are a protected category, they may not be discriminated against and must be treated as equals. Please stop asking who the android is. Think of this mysterious robotic creation as just another colleague.

It's that time of the year again! Chief Medical Officer Brugmann will be issuing mandatory allergy shots in the Sector F Infirmary. Please get your shot as soon as possible.

**06-11-2306 - New Entry**

Interim Commanding Officer Golding and DynaMars Corporation would like to remind all station personnel that just because Resident #055's head caught on fire and started shooting sparks does not mean he is an android. As Resident #055 was completely unharmed by the incident, he will be returning to work immediately. Do not accuse him of being an android.

In all likelihood Resident #055 simply suffered a mild reaction to his allergy shot.

**06-12-2306 - New Entry**

Interim Commanding Officer Golding and DynaMars Corporation would like to remind all station personnel that just because Resident #055 become stuck to one of the magnetic docking clamps in the Sector A Shipyards does not mean he is an android with a metal skeleton. Many station residents have metal parts sensitive to magnetic instruments.

Interstellar Police are warning of increased Mercury Syndicate activity on Mars. Interim Commanding Officer Golding is putting Cycnus Station on high alert. Please report any suspicious activity immediately.

**06-13-2306 - New Entry**

Interim Commanding Officer Golding and DynaMars Corporation kindly ask that all personnel refrain from reporting Resident #055 for suspicious behavior. He is not an android and just because he was caught disabling the security system on the Sector B Airlock Doors does not mean he is suspicious. If he was an android, he wouldn't be able to tamper with station equipment because it would violate his programming.

In other news, DynaMars Corporation has learned that members of the deadly Mercury Syndicate criminal empire have taken up residence in the nearby abandoned Ares Station. Residents are advised to avoid Ares Station even more so than they already do.

**06-14-2306 - New Entry**

DynaMars Corporation is extremely disappointed to report an apparent hate crime on Cycnus Station. Some cowardly personnel, attempting to out Resident #055 as an android, set off a small electromagnetic pulse grenade that caused him to faint and drop BLUE-CRATE #000355, which he was carrying above his head.

Interim Commanding Officer Golding and DynaMars Corporation would like to remind residents that just because Resident #055 fainted after the EMP was detonated does not mean he is an android. In all likelihood he fainted from complications related to his allergy shot. And since he got right back up after the incident, he is clearly not an android. Furthermore, EMP devices are not to be detonated without first filing ELECTROMAGNETIC PULSE DETONATION FORM 244/B.

The guilty culprits are hereby ordered to attend Workplace Sensitivity Seminar #003 at 0700 hours in the Sector G Human Resources Conference Room.

Good news! To improve station morale, Interim Commanding Officer Golding has scheduled a showing of the romantic comedy Love Cop: Precinct of the Heart in the Sector H Cinemas at 1800 hours tomorrow! There will be complimentary popcorn and Shasta Cola for all who attend.

**06-15-2306 - New Entry**

DynaMars Corporation is deeply saddened to report that Interim Commanding Officer Golding has been captured by Mercury Syndicate pirates. Although several personnel reported seeing Resident #055 escorting Interim Commanding Officer Golding at gunpoint and handing him over to pirates entering through the Sector B Airlock, this does not indicate he is an android. As we noted before, the android is very friendly and this behavior is far from friendly.

Resident #055 and the Mercury Syndicate pirates escaped with Interim Commanding Officer Golding back to Ares Station. In light of these serious developments, movie night has been canceled.

**06-16-2306 - New Entry**

Good news!

The Mercury Syndicate has released a video showing Interim Commanding Officer Golding alive and mostly unscathed! They are demanding a ransom of 350,000 credits for his safe return. Unfortunately, DynaMars Corporation is not in the business of negotiating with terrorists. The matter has been turned over to Interstellar Police, currently scheduled to arrive at Cycnus Station in 18 days. Mark your calendars!

Resident #013 has taken up a collection in hopes of raising the ransom money demanded by the nefarious pirates. If you see Orange Multipurpose Bucket #0051, please contribute what you can. With any luck, Interim Commanding Officer Golding will be returned to us in one barely mutilated piece!

**06-17-2306 - New Entry**

DynaMars Corporation is extremely disturbed to hear that Orange Multipurpose Bucket #0051 has gone missing. Resident #013 reported Orange Multipurpose Bucket #0051 was removed from the Sector I Mess Hall where he left it. DynaMars Corporation would like to remind all residents that Orange Multipurpose Bucket #0051 is company property and must therefore be returned immediately.

DynaMars Corproration maintains a zero tolerance policy in regards to theft of company property. Recovery of Orange Multipurpose Bucket #0051 is now company priority.

**06-19-2306 - New Entry**

Because Orange Multipurpose Bucket #0051 has not been returned, DynaMars Corporation has no choice but to declare martial law on Cycnus Station. Mobile Defense Sentry Units are now patrolling the halls with shoot-to-kill orders. If Orange Multipurpose Bucket #0051 is not recovered within 48 hours, life support systems will be shut off.

**06-20-2306 - New Entry**

Good news! The Mercury Syndicate pirates and Resident #055 are all dead. While attempting to invade and take over Cycnus Station, they were caught wholly unprepared to deal with the small army of Mobile Defense Sentry Units patrolling the halls with shoot-to-kill orders.

In other news it appears one of the Mercury Syndicate members was carrying the severed head of Interim Commanding Officer Golding. Please do not mourn for Interim Commanding Officer Golding. As he was a friendly android, his head need only be reattached to a new body. Supplementary bodies for Interim Commanding Officer Golding can be found inside BLUE-CRATE #000355.

**06-21-2306 - New Entry**

The parade of good news continues!

It appears Orange Multipurpose Bucket #0051 has been recovered. As it turns out, Orange Multipurpose Bucket #0051 was mistakenly left in the Sector D Mess Hall and not the nearly identical Sector I Mess Hall. We apologize for the confusion and to the families and friends of the thirteen crewmembers gunned down by the Mobile Defense Sentry Units. Martial law is hereby lifted.

With all major obstacles now removed, DynaMars Corporation looks forward to all surviving Cycnus Station personnel returning to work immediately!
