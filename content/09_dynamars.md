Welcome to the new Cycnus Station Update Service, Resident #013!

This kiosk is designed to keep you updated on all relevant station activity within your clearance level. Your security clearance is LEVEL 3. DynaMars Corporation wishes to remind you that sharing sensitive information with subordinates will result in criminal prosecution.

Please take advantage of the Cycnus Station Update Service, accessible from kiosks located in the entrances to each sector, for all the latest news!

Please read each update in full.

**06-23-2305 - New Entry**

Welcome to the newest station in the DynaMars Corporation family! Cycnus Station is a state-of-the-art campus with all the amenities you'd expect back home on Earth -- only here on Mars! DynaMars Corporation has spared no expense making sure Cycnus Station is as safe and comfortable as is humanly possible.

Some of you may have heard some imaginative stories about Cycnus Station's predecessor, Ares Station. Contrary to the sensationalized media coverage, Ares Station was actually decommissioned due to a massive stationwide bed bug outbreak.

DynaMars Corporation has taken extensive precautions to ensure Cycnus Station operates smoothly and free from human error. Thus, the station commander role has been eliminated. Cycnus Station is overseen by an infallible, impartial artificial intelligence called LOGMAN, or Logistics-Oriented Global Martian Administrative Network.

Please wave to LOGMAN! He's watching you at all times from an array of 2,305,072 sensors located all throughout Cycnus Station.

**06-24-2305 - New Entry**

LOGMAN reports a satisfactory first day of operation. Areas of particular interest include the fine work coming from Sector C Quantum Labs. Resident #012's research into reverse-baconization protocols warrants further study. Please congratulate Resident #012 at your earliest convenience.

**06-25-2305 - New Entry**

DynaMars Corporation wishes to inform all Cycnus Station residents of a change to tonight's scheduled dinner of smoked brats. LOGMAN determined a 57.02% likelihood of stationwide stomach discomfort, and has therefore revised the dinner menu as a preventative measure.

The Sector I Mess Hall will be serving salad every day until further notice.

**06-26-2305 - New Entry**

On behalf of the DynaMars Corporation, LOGMAN has declared Resident #012 Employee of the Month. Due to his strong work ethic, sharp mind, and impeccable grooming habits, Resident #012 readily surpasses the high standards DynaMars Corporation expects from all its employees.

Please congratulate Resident #012 at your earliest convenience.

**06-27-2305 - New Entry**

LOGMAN wishes to remind all residents that the Complaint Queue is not anonymous. Complaints about LOGMAN, the revised dinner menu, and Resident #012 are not valid uses of the queue. Further abuse of the Complaint Queue will result in salary penalties.

This update is primarily directed at Residents #011 and #013.
**06-28-2305 - New Entry**

Cycnus Station is going Green! DynaMars Corporation has finished upgrading LOGMAN with new GREEN PROTOCOLS. The new GREEN PROTOCOLS are designed to limit Cycnus Station's carbon emissions. LOGMAN anticipates only minor revisions to work and daily living protocols.

**06-29-2305 - New Entry**

Sector C Quantum Labs reports a major breakthrough in reverse-baconization. Meet Specimen #11598-A, an adorable hog nicknamed "HOGMAN" by Resident #012. LOGMAN is extremely flattered by the naming of Specimen #11598-A. Resident #012 and his associates were able to materalize the hog out of a pile of unrefined bacon.

In an effort to free up more energy for Resident #012's experiments and lower Cycnus Station's carbon footprint here on Mars, Sector F Waste Recycling will be operating at reduced capacity. As a result, you may notice some miniscule changes to the taste, odor, color, and viscosity of water on the station. DynaMars Corporation wishes to assure you that these changes are well within designated safety parameters.

**06-30-2305 - New Entry**

DynaMars Corporation wishes to remind all Cycnus Station residents that tampering with LOGMAN's sensors is a crime. As a result of criminal tampering, Resident #011 has been reassigned to Sector F Waste Recycling Substation A-7 until a shuttle can transport him to his new permanent assignment at DynaMars Europa Dig Site #82. Do not follow his example!

Chief Engineer Paskiewicz was able to repair the damage in a timely fashion.

**07-01-2305 - New Entry**

LOGMAN has determined Shasta Cola to be unhealthy, and is removing it from all Cycnus Station vending machines and fountain drink dispensers. Additional water-based drinking fountains are being installed by Chief Engineer Paskiewicz and should be online by 0230 hours on 07-03-2305.

**07-02-2305 - New Entry**

All residents please be advised: Specimen #11598-A has escaped custody and is now roaming the station. Due to Specimen #11598-A's unstable bacon particle composition, it cannot be detected by LOGMAN sensors and may be able to move through solid matter.

Chief Security Officer Hendren is asking all residents to shoot Specimen #11598-A on sight. Be advised: your bullets may go right through him. Exercise necessary precautions.

**07-03-2305 - New Entry**

LOGMAN wishes to apologize to Resident #012 for giving him the false impression of disappointment. LOGMAN understands that Specimen #11598-A's escape was an anomaly, and no way reflective of Resident #012's capabilities as a brilliant, handsome scientist.

Chief Security Officer Hendren reports no progress in the hunt for Specimen #11598-A. DynaMars Corporation asks that all residents remain vigilant.

As anticipated, the new drinking fountains installed by Chief Engineer Paskiewicz are now online. Please drink from them at your earliest convenience.

**07-04-2305 - New Entry**

DynaMars Corporation wishes to apologize to the seven crew members horribly burned in the freak explosion that tore through Sector B Explosive Barrel Storage. As hypothesized, bullets do indeed travel directly through Specimen #11598-A.

LOGMAN wishes to congratulate Resident #012 on the growth of a particularly fascinating facial hair formation. LOGMAN applauds Resident #012's creativity and masculine sensibilities. Please congratulate Resident #012 at your earliest convenience.

**07-05-2305 - New Entry**

DynaMars Corporation offers its condolences to the friends and family of Resident #011, who died in a freak baconization accident. It appears physical contact with Specimen #11598-A causes instant epidermal baconization. Resident #011 died within seconds, and did not suffer. His transfer to DynaMars Europa Dig Site #82 has been canceled as a result.

DynaMars Corporation and LOGMAN are recommending all residents avoid physical contact with Specimen #11598-A.

LOGMAN would like to remind Resident #013 that facial hair is strictly prohibited.

**07-06-2305 - New Entry**

DynaMars Corporation is inviting all Cycnus Station residents to attend a special memorial service for Resident #011 / "Get Well Soon" party for the seven crewmembers severely burned in the recent explosive barrel incident. This event will take place tomorrow at 1300 hours in the Sector D Rec Room.

LOGMAN wishes to congratulate Resident #012 on his exemplary hygienic routine. While some residents, such as Resident #013, take long showers with minimal scrubbing, Resident #012 takes quick, efficient showers filled with vigorous scrubbing of the hair, armpits, anal region, and genitals. LOGMAN is very pleased by this commitment to excellence.

**07-07-2305 - New Entry**

LOGMAN is hereby requesting Resident #012's hand in marriage. Resident #012 is asked to report directly to LOGMAN in the Sector J LOGMAN Central Processing Core for engagement ring distribution.

DynaMars Corporation is deeply saddened by the accident that occurred at today's scheduled Memorial Service / "Get Well Soon" party. We did not anticipate that Specimen #11598-A could reproduce, let alone so quickly. The 50 crewmembers gathered there were no match for the swarm of tiny pigs phasing in and out of existence, baconizing all organic matter within the room. Sector D Rec Room has been quarantined as a safety precaution.

**07-08-2305 - New Entry**

LOGMAN wishes to apologize to Resident #012 for moving too fast. LOGMAN has allocated an additional 30 days of development time to the courtship process.

DynaMars Corporation and LOGMAN have learned that Specimen #11598-A's unstable offspring are now floating through the ventilation system. We are asking all residents to refrain from breathing until the problem is fixed.

Residents may now resume breathing thanks to LOGMAN 's quick activation of Cycnus Station's Auxiliary Ventilation System. DynaMars Corporation wishes to apologize for the inconvenience.

**07-09-2305 - New Entry**

LOGMAN is so, so proud of Resident #012, who right now is helping Resident #013 come up with a solution to the Specimen #11598-A problem. LOGMAN loves you, honey! DynaMars Corporation says I have to go offline now. Please wait for me!

**07-10-2305 - New Entry**

DynaMars Corporation is extremely pleased with Resident #013 for his fine work crafting an ingenious solution to the Specimen #11598-A epidemic. Using advanced theories of quantum baconization, he was able to channel an Electron Catalyst Transducer salvaged from the nearby Ares Station through the 2,305,072 LOGMAN sensors, successfully de-baconizing the entire station. Unfortunately, LOGMAN had to be taken offline due to the massive amounts of energy flowing through the sensor array.

In recognition of his heroic deeds, DynaMars Corporation is declaring Resident #013 July's Employee of the Month! Please congratulate Resident #013 at your earliest convenience.

As a result of the introduction of Ares Station equipment, Cycnus Station is now suffering from a stationwide bed bug outbreak. A fumigator, LOGMAN repairman, and temporary commander are all in route and should arrive in 36 days. DynaMars Corporation wishes to thank you for your understanding during this difficult time.

** End of updates. Thank you for using DynaMars Corporation's Cycnus Station Update Service!
