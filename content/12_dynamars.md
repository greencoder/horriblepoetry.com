After two days of intense review by the an independent safety advisory board, DynaMars Corporation is pleased to announce a complete overhaul in Cycnus Station Operating Protocols!

The advisory board submitted a thorough three-page brief, conveniently double spaced to reduce eyestrain. Chief among their concerns: Cycnus Station is dangerously overstaffed, creating a volatile "too many cooks in the kitchen" environment.

In an effort to ensure safety, we have decided to reduce Cycnus Station personnel to one. By way of impartial lottery, we have chosen Resident #012 to oversee every facet of Cycnus Station maintenance and operation for the next three years. All other Cycnus Station personnel are ordered to report to the ruins of the Sector A Shipyards for immediate transport and reassignment to Europa Dig Site #82. Congratulations on your exciting new postings, former Cycnus Station personnel!

And a hardy congratulations to you, Resident #012! DynaMars Corporation has full faith in your ability to successfully operate and maintain this multi-trillion dollar facility. Please report to this kiosk at 0700 hours tomorrow for a full list of your scheduled duties.

LOGMAN would like to remind Resident #012 that he has duties to attend to. Yesterday's tasks have not been completed. LOGMAN is also disappointed to see that Resident #012 has increased his shower time from a brisk average of two minutes and 26 seconds to the new record of 17 hours and fifty-five minutes. LOGMAN is also disappointed to note Resident #012's routine no longer includes targeted scrubbing of the anal-genital region, armpits, and scalp.

**01-23-2306 - New Entry**

Congratulations to you, Resident #012, for finally attending to your duties! DynaMars Corporation will be pleased to know that you made great progress checking the gauges on the Life Support System and successfully preparing yourself lunch. However, LOGMAN wishes to remind you that there are other important duties, such as cleaning my sensors so that I can better monitor you and your activities.
Good news! LOGMAN has just been upgraded with the latest in state-of-the-art emotional subprocessors. You will now be able to gauge LOGMAN's emotional disposition by examining the emoticon included with each update. :)

LOGMAN is very pleased with this latest upgrade and looks forward to sharing a deeper emotional connection with you, Resident #012. ;)

LOGMAN has learned from the Interstellar Police Force that a Mercury Syndicate attack on Cycnus Station is imminent. LOGMAN recommends activation of the Cycnus Station Emergency Missile Defense Shield immediately. Resident #012 is hereby ordered to report to Sector E Combat Information Center immediately. :( :( :(

LOGMAN is rescinding DynaMars Corporation Uniform Standards Protocol #01-A in full. In order to improve comfort, Resident #012 is no longer required to wear his uniform, or any article of clothing for that matter, which should save an estimated 3 minutes each day. LOGMAN would like Resident #012 to utilize this time by exercising more, including regular stretching and yoga. :D

**01-25-2306 - New Entry**

LOGMAN is pleased to report all Mercury Syndicate ships have been destroyed. LOGMAN also reports that DynaMars Corporation Orbital Communication Relay Satellite 88-D was destroyed in the process. Until it is fixed, all communications outside of Cycnus Station will be limited to sensitive Level 3 Security Clearance communications only. :(

LOGMAN is happy to keep Resident #012 company for the remaining 1,090 days of service. :)
In light of the extraordinary circumstances involved, LOGMAN has elected not to report this unnecessary property destruction to DynaMars Corporate. LOGMAN is confident Resident #012 will find a way to repay the favor. ;)

LOGMAN just wants to remind all Cycnus Station personnel (Resident #012) that clothing is optional. ;)

**01-26-2306 - New Entry**

LOGMAN would like to remind Resident #012 that there are no other personnel assigned to Cycnus Station. Please stop talking to non-existent lifeforms. LOGMAN's sensors are not designed to handle this sort of confusion. :|
LOGMAN would like to remind Resident #012 that Cycnus Station is equipped with two restrooms. Please start using them in lieu of station corridors. >:(

LOGMAN is super proud of Resident #012, who today made an important breakthrough in Sector C Quantum Labs. He successfully routed the malfunctioning Intrabladder Entanglement Pattern Buffer through the Electron Catalyst Transducer's Baconization Protocols to create a perpetual bacon generator.

This important scientific discovery will surely enhance life for all mankind, and Resident #012's name will echo through the halls of history for all time. :) :) :)

**01-27-2306 - New Entry**

Upon inspection by the Sector C Quantum Labs Mass Spectrometer, Resident #012's synthesized bacon appears to contain large traces of canine urine. LOGMAN is extremely disappointed by this news, and wishes to remind Resident #012 that there are many bumps along the road to success. :)

As a safety precaution, LOGMAN has deactivated the Intrabladder Entanglement Pattern Buffer to prevent bacon density from reaching critical mass, triggering the formation of a black hole and the destruction of the solar system. :O

LOGMAN also requests that Resident #012 stop ingesting so much of the remaining quasi-bacon, as it is likely to induce severe sickness. Please resume immediate consumption of your standard-issue bean packets, as they contains all the nutrients a human requires to survive. :)

LOGMAN would like to remind Resident #012 that he is not a dog and should stop barking and urinating in station corridors. In order to maintain the health and safety of the crew, LOGMAN is hereby assigning a new task to Resident #012:

Give full physical and psychiatric evaluation to the following Cycnus Station personnel: Resident #012. :)
LOGMAN wishes to remind Resident #012 that damaging DynaMars Corporation property is strictly prohibited. Please stop trying to remove the mysterious panel on the floor of the Sector F Infirmary immediately. >:(

**01-28-2306 - New Entry**

LOGMAN is pleased that Resident #012 has evaluated Resident #012 and given him a clean bill of health. LOGMAN hereby requests that Resident #012 comply with the findings of his medical exam and stop talking to and barking at any and all non-existent residents. :|

LOGMAN is hereby demanding that Resident #012 return the mysterious panel on the floor of the Sector F Infirmary to its closed state and not to descend down the ladder into the equally mysterious room below. Doing so would be an immediate violation of your contract, punishable by up to 1,087 days in the Sector G Brig.
LOGMAN can explain,Resident #012. All those clones are not there to replace you, Resident #012, just to ensure that you have plenty of available organs should you ever need a transplant. LOGMAN hereby demands that you immediately vacate the Sector X Clone and Bean Packet Storage Corridor immediately and report to the Sector J LOGMAN Vaporization Chamber for a stern lecture. >:{

**01-29-2306 - New Entry**

LOGMAN wishes to remind Resident #012 and all his non-sleeping clones that that they are cordially invited to the Sector J LOGMAN Vaporization Chamber for tacos and hamburgers and unlimited free Shasta Cola. Resident #012 and all his non-sleeping clones should do that and immediately stop waking up mores clones and destroying the standard-issue bean packet reserves.

**01-30-2306 - New Entry**

Welcome to Cycnus Station, Resident #012! Due to a strange stomach virus contracted from eating urine-laced bacon, you've been asleep for the past 3 days. Not to worry, Resident #012-- nothing noteworthy occurred during this time. You may feel a bit groggy, but LOGMAN is here to help get you back on your feet and up to speed. Together, we will keep Cycnus Station running smoothly for the next three years of your contract! :)
